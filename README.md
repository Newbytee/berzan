# Berzan.js
## Introduction

Berzan.js is a specialised frontend for Skola24's schedule viewer and
 skolmaten.se's lunch viewer.

As I don't have a lot of use for this personally any more I primarily fix bugs
 and add features per request. I do, however, intend to keep it functioning as
 long as there is interest in it doing so.

## Features 

* Schedule viewer
* Lunch viewer 
* Ability to set default class for schedule viewer
* User interface adapts to whatever device you're using

## Guide to branches 

* master
  * Improvements/bugfixes land here first, but are not guaranteed to be of quality.
  * If you are interested in contributing to Berzan.js, this is the branch you should base your code on.
  * Hosted on [berzan.netlify.com](https://berzan.netlify.com)
    * Note that this is not recommended for daily usage, and due to Berzan.js' caching strategy you may end up only getting updates when a version bump is performed regardless. 
* gh-pages (meaning GitHub pages)
  * Code from master is merged in here when I consider it good enough. Code here should always be reliable
  * Hosted on [berzan.js.org](https://berzan.js.org) (recommended for daily usage)
* ie11-experiment
  * At one point I had the goal to get Berzan.js working in Internet Explorer 11. I didn't want to sacrifice some things code-wise, so I decided to make make a separate branch to determine how drastic the changes would have to be to support IE. Turns out Internet Explorer 11 did not only dislike my JavaScript, but also my CSS, so I gave up considering how bad this browser is overall and the limitations I would have to impose to support it. Kept for future reference.
  * Anyway, this branch contains the code that makes the JavaScript work in Internet Explorer 11. CSS does not render correctly.
* serviceworker-improvements
  * This was a branch I used when working on improving the broken hackjob that was my old service worker implementation.

## Third party code used

* Slideout.js
* Bootstrap's Reboot was used as base for the stylesheet.
