# Berzan.js
## Introduction
Berzan.js is a specialised frontend for Novasoftware's schedule viewer and skolmaten.se's lunch viewer.

It is currently perpetually developed, with features being added and bugs fixed as I find the motivation and inspiration to. The goal is to make it work across as many devices as well as possible while maintaining its stability, speed, and features.

## Dependancies
